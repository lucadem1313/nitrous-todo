![Dev Version - 7/11/2016](newpagescreenshot.png)

## Guidelines
##### Manage Tasks (required)
- As a user, I can add new tasks to my list so that I know what I have to get done.
- As a user, I can mark tasks on my to do list as completed so that I know what I have accomplished.
- As a user, I can set tasks as highly important, moderately important, or of low importance (default) so that I can know what is the most important.
- As a user, I can delete tasks so that my task list is not filled with irrelevant tasks.
- As a user, I can edit tasks that are created so that I can accurately reflect changes.
